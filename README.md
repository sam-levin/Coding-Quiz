# Coding-Quiz

This is a project for the UCB Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this project was to use Web APIs to learn how the user can interact with the DOM. 

## Features

The quiz is a interactive quiz 
It allows users to answer questions by clicking on buttons
When a wrong answer is clicked, time is subtracted from the clock
When a correct answer is clicked, no time is subtracted
When the timer is over or when all the questions are answered, the quiz is over 
When the quiz is over, the user is prompted to input their initials
After the user submits their initials, a high score board will show up
This data is stored in the local storage, so the user can compare themselves to previous tries
